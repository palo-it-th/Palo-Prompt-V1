## Reasoning Test

Here are 5 reasoning test questions based on time zone differences and meeting setups:

1. Jessica lives in New York (GMT -5) and her colleague Mark lives in London (GMT +0). If Jessica wants to schedule a video call at 9am her time, what time would that be for Mark?

2. A company has offices in San Francisco (GMT -8), Tokyo (GMT +9), and Berlin (GMT +1). They need to schedule a meeting that works for attendees in all three locations. If the meeting is at 8am San Francisco time, what times would that be in Tokyo and Berlin?

3. Sarah is traveling from Sydney, Australia (GMT +10) to Chicago (GMT -6) for a business meeting. Her flight leaves Sydney at 10pm on Monday and arrives in Chicago at 9pm on the same calendar day. How many hours was Sarah's flight?

4. Alex has to join a conference call from his home in Mumbai (GMT +5:30) with colleagues in Toronto (GMT -5) and Santiago (GMT -4). If the meeting is scheduled for 3pm Toronto time, what time would that be for Alex in Mumbai and his colleague in Santiago?

5. A distributed team has members in Auckland (GMT +12), Dubai (GMT +4), and Rio de Janeiro (GMT -3). They want to schedule a 2-hour meeting sometime between 6am and 6pm Auckland time when everyone is available. What is the range of times they could choose for the meeting that would work for everyone?
